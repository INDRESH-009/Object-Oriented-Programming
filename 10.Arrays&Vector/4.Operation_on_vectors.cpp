    /* Ì‰
     1. at() method in vectors is used to access the elements of the array like the [index] method 
     2. v[1] and v.at(1) both get the same output viz the element present in the 1st index of v.

    Key Differences Between at() and []:

    1. Bounds Checking:
    at(): Throws a std::out_of_range exception if the index is out of the valid range of the vector.
    []: Does not perform bounds checking and can lead to undefined behavior if the index is out of bounds.

    2. Use Case:
    Use at() when you want to ensure safety and need bounds checking.
    Use [] when you're confident that the index will always be within the valid range and need maximum performance.  






    Lets assume we have a vector oif size 10 and we are tying to access the element at index 100 viz out of bound then what is the difference in using the at() method and subscript operator [].

    Case 1: v[100]
    Behavior: The subscript operator [] does not perform bounds checking.
    Outcome: Accessing v[100] will lead to undefined behavior because you are trying to access an element well beyond the valid range of indices (which should be 0 to 9 for a vector of size 10).
    In the best-case scenario, it might return some garbage value.
    In the worst case, it could cause a segmentation fault or crash your program, depending on what lies in the memory location that v[100] tries to access.


    Case 2: v.at(100)
    Behavior: The at() method does perform bounds checking.
    Outcome: Accessing v.at(100) will throw a std::out_of_range exception because index 100 is out of the valid range.
    The exception can be caught using a try-catch block, and you can handle the error gracefully.
